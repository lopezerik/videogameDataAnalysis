# Intro to Data Science

Library files for the course will be kept here.

## Getting Started

Set up your own local git folder. Cloning the project is one way to do that.

### Prerequisites

The code in the library files is written in Python 2.7. You need that installed.

## Contributing

The code is open (public) for pull requests. At the moment, I am not accepting push requests. If you see a bug,
make a note of it under issues tab.
